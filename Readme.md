# Welcome to my New Portfolio!
    I wanted to take a minimal approach to my portfolio, so this whas not only created from vanilla languages( with the acceptions of a couple of cdn libraries) I stripped off the photo from the previous version to bring emphasis to my projects.

## languages used:
    * html
    * css3
    * javascript
## with help from these cdn's:
    * w3schools
    * font awesome
